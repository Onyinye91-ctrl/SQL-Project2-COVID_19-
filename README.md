# SQL-Project2-COVID_19-
## Introduction
The Covid_19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and led to the dramatic loss of lives and livelihoods. Its impact continues to affect the way in we live and interact. In this project, you will analyze sample data related to COVID-19 cases as recorded from January 2019 to December, 2020.

## Task:
### Part A:
1.	Download the Covid_19_data.csv file using this link .
2.	Load the data into a table in mysql Database. 
3.	Write suitable sql queries to analyze and generate insight from the data.
Below are the questions you are to write SQL queries to find answers to:
1.	Retrieve the total confirmed, death, and recovered cases.
2.	Retrieve the total confirmed, deaths and recovered cases for the first quarter of each year of observation.
3.	Retrieve a summary of all the records. This should include the following information for each country:

4.	Retrieve the percentage increase in the number of death cases from 2019 to 2020.
5.	Retrieve information for the top 5 countries with the highest confirmed cases.
6.	Compute the total number of drop (decrease) or increase in the confirmed cases from month to month in the 2 years of observation.

### Part B:
The final goal of the assignment is to create a “Covid_19_Status Report” in a reporting tool of your choice (PowerBI or Tableau) that contains graphs that presents your answers in part A above. You can choose any type and format of graphs at your choice to present your insights.
